        <h4>About me</h4>
        <p>
          Hi there. I'm James, and I'm a second year Software Engineering student studying at the University of Technology Sydney.
          I have a demonstrable passion for programming and everything software related, having spent
          countless hours on self-study and working on personal projects.
          <br><br>
          I technically started programming when I was around ten years old, messing around with Java and OpenGL but not really understanding a thing I was doing, and eventually giving up. 
          About two or three years later, however, I started programming small games in GameMaker Studio and ended up designing and developing some websites. I consider my programming skills to have grown 
          somewhat exponentially over the past one or two years in particular, and have since created substantially more complex tech demos, games, and software. 
          <br><br>
          If you are interested in browsing the source code for some of my projects (including for this very website), click 
          <a href="https://github.com/jaaamesey/">here</a>.
          <br><br>
          Builds for a few of my projects are also available 
          <a href="projects/index.html">here<a>.
