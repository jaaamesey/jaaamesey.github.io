        <h4>Learning journal</h4>
        <p>The following entries are an account of my learning experiences while taking
          Engineering Practice Preparation 1.
        </p>
        <h5>Week 1</h5>
        <p>
          This week served as an introduction to the subject, 
          whilst also introducing us to the concept of workplace learning.
          We were also asked to write a few paragraphs on
          our understanding of engineering identity:
          <br><br>
          <em style="font-family: serif"> 
            Engineering identity refers to an engineer or engineering student's perceived role, value, and agency
            within the wider scope of their industry. Skill level, knowledge, and prior experience
            heavily contribute to one's sense of belonging and identity as an engineer within their community of
            practice; this sense in turn is associated with persistence and retention in academic programs and 
            the deepening of one's commitment to their career (Schell and Hughes, 2017). 
            <br><br>

            The process of "becoming an engineer" is referred to as "legitimate peripheral participation", 
            which is made up of three primary activities: the mastery of disciplinary knowledge, the navigation of formal and informal pathways
            into the profession, and the identification by others and oneself as an engineer. With regards to myself, 
            my navigation of formal and informal pathways and identification as an engineer is quite limited due to 
            lack of formal prior experience, and I find it difficult to quantify my mastery of disciplinary knowledge
            for similar reasons.
            <br><br>

            To develop my sense of engineering identity further, I will have to gain more formal experience in my field, 
            with increased exposure to professional software development environments. My sense of identity will also likely
            be furthered by conversing with established practitioners and applying relevant advice.

        </p>

        <h5>Week 2</h5>
        <p>
            In week 2, we were introduced to the "sandwich" model of providing feedback, where criticisms are wrapped in an 
            easy to digest shell of multigrain bread, as well as the concepts of human, social, and cultural capital. Having been 
            born and raised in Australia, the same country I am looking for work in, the amount I will need to invest in cultural 
            capital will be minimal compared to the amount I will need to invest into human and social capital. Currently, the closest
            thing I have to social capital would be my membership to ProgSoc and participation in hackathons and game jams; thus, there
            is plenty of room for improvement in this area.
            <br><br>
            I have found the learning in this subject to be different to subjects relevant to my field; it is far more personal and more 
            about the development of the various soft skills that can be of use in a professional engineering environment.
        </p>

        <h5>Week 3</h5>
        This week, we had to fill out a table of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timely) goals.
