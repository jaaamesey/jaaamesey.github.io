        <h4>Learning journal</h4>
        <p>The following entries are an account of my learning experiences while taking
          Engineering Practice Preparation 1.
        </p>
        <h5>Week 1 - Workplace Learning</h5>
        <p>
          This week served as an introduction to the subject,
          whilst also introducing us to the concept of workplace learning.
          We were also asked to write a few paragraphs on
          our understanding of engineering identity:
          <br><br>
          <em style="font-family: serif">
            Engineering identity refers to an engineer or engineering student's perceived role, value, and agency
            within the wider scope of their industry. Skill level, knowledge, and prior experience
            heavily contribute to one's sense of belonging and identity as an engineer within their community of
            practice; this sense in turn is associated with persistence and retention in academic programs and
            the deepening of one's commitment to their career (Schell and Hughes, 2017).
            <br><br>

            The process of "becoming an engineer" is referred to as "legitimate peripheral participation",
            which is made up of three primary activities: the mastery of disciplinary knowledge, the navigation of
            formal and informal pathways
            into the profession, and the identification by others and oneself as an engineer. With regards to myself,
            my navigation of formal and informal pathways and identification as an engineer is quite limited due to
            lack of formal prior experience, and I find it difficult to quantify my mastery of disciplinary knowledge
            for similar reasons.
            <br><br>

            To develop my sense of engineering identity further, I will have to gain more formal experience in my field,
            with increased exposure to professional software development environments. My sense of identity will also
            likely
            be furthered by conversing with established practitioners and applying relevant advice.
          </em>
          <br><br>
          <img src="images/bank.jpg" width="20%">
          <br><br>
          We were also asked to take a photo that represents what professional engineering practice means to us. I chose
          this motorised face piggy bank
          as it contains many different components that would have each required considerable amounts of thought to put
          into, despite the bank itself
          existing as a children's money saving mechanism at best and a cheap novelty at worst. To accept a coin, it
          must open its mouth and swallow it; this
          is achieved through a spinning motor attached to part of its "skin". To know when a coin is placed near its
          mouth, it uses an always-on motion sensor.
          To power it, it takes two AA batteries. Despite how simple this item seems on the surface, and how easy it is
          to use, it still would have had to
          go through the research, development, and manufacturing stages, as well as any stages in between. Thus, I feel
          that this item is representative of how
          engineers are required to put considerable amounts of thought and effort into things that an ordinary user of
          the item would see as small and inconsequential,
          and how even something as simple to the user as "put coin in mouth" require an understanding of many different
          components to implement. Engineers have to
          think about all the things that the users of a product don't, which is why I feel that this item is
          representative of
          professional engineering practice.
          <br><br>
          I also formally joined ProgSoc this week, a
          UTS society of programmers that hosts events and helps connect members to the industry.
          <br><br>
        </p>

        <h5>Week 2 - Feedback and Human, Social, and Cultural Capital</h5>
        <p>
          In week 2, we were introduced to the "sandwich" model of providing feedback, where criticisms are wrapped in
          an
          easy to digest shell of multigrain bread, as well as the concepts of human, social, and cultural capital.
          Having been
          born and raised in Australia, the same country I am looking for work in, the amount I will need to invest in
          cultural
          capital will be minimal compared to the amount I will need to invest into human and social capital. Currently,
          the closest
          thing I have to social capital would be my membership to ProgSoc and participation in hackathons and game
          jams; thus, there
          is plenty of room for improvement in this area in the future, but I believe that the skills associated with my
          human capital
          make up for it for the time being and would be significantly more important to a prospective employer. This
          week, I attended
          a meeting with a company in Sydney about a potential internship opportunity, and although I was intoduced to
          the opportunity
          through a neighbour, they were far more interested in technical skills, team skills, and work ethic compared
          to what people
          and organisations I was associated with.
          <br><br>
          I have found the learning in this subject to be different to subjects relevant to my field; it is far more
          personal and more
          about the development of the various soft skills that can be of use in a professional engineering environment.
          <br><br>
        </p>

        <h5>Week 3 - Goals</h5>
        <p>
          This week, we had to fill out a table of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timely) goals.
          <br><br>
          <table style="width:100%">
            <tr>
              <th>Specific</th>
              <td>What do you want to learn? <br>Who needs to be involved to accomplish these goals?</td>
              <td>
                <ol>
                  <li>I want to learn how to develop software in a professional setting. This requires the establishment
                    of a mentoring relationship with an established software developer.</li>
                  <li>I want to learn how to effectively and efficiently manage a large project. This would require me
                    to have practice with projects involving multiple developers, designers, testers, stakeholders, etc.
                  </li>
                  <li>I want to have a steady stream of personal projects to work on so that I may learn the skills
                    required for similar projects that I would be a part of during professional practice. These personal
                    projects would be developed soley by myself to further my understanding of all components involved.
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <th>Measurable</th>
              <td>How can you measure your progress?</td>
              <td>
                <ol>
                  <li>Progress is difficult to measure, but can be qualitatively measured by how capable I feel and how
                    well I assimilate into a professional software development environment.</li>
                  <li>Again, this is something difficult to quantifiably measure. Ideally, I would want to have worked
                    on and managed a large project in some form, resulting in a positive and informative experience.
                  </li>
                  <li>I want to have at least 2 small to medium sized projects completed each year, with the source code
                    in a good enough state to show publically on GitHub. </li>
                </ol>
              </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <th>Achievable</th>
              <td>Do you have the needed skills?<br>If not, how can you build them?</td>
              <td>
                <ol>
                  <li>I feel like I have many of the required skills to develop software professionally. However, skills
                    relevant to working in teams is something that I will only be able to achieve through experience.
                  </li>
                  <li>I feel like my project management skills are somewhat lacking as a whole, and could be built by
                    working on more group projects such as hackathons or university assignments.</li>
                  <li>I feel that I have the required time and skills to work on these projects. </li>
                </ol>
              </td>
            </tr>


            <tr>
              <th>Relevant</th>
              <td>Why should you achieve these goals? <br>What is the impact?</td>
              <td>
                <ol>
                  <li>Having the capacity to contribute effectively to software in a professional development
                    environment will substantially increase my employability and make me feel like I belong in such an
                    environment, affirming my engineering identity and creating a positive feedback cycle.</li>
                  <li>Having good project management skills would be essential in the event of me being tasked to handle
                    any sort of project. Working on a large project in particular would give me a lot of skills
                    applicable to all project sizes that most people would not think about when working on a smaller
                    project, providing me with great insight into how to improve a team's effectiveness and efficiency.
                  </li>
                  <li>Having a lot of completed projects visible to employers, along with their source code, would
                    substantially increase my perceived value as a software engineer. Additionally, I would gain
                    substantial experience from these projects and demonstrate a commitment to learning the craft.</li>
                </ol>
              </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <th>Timely</th>
              <td>What is the due date of your goals? </td>
              <td>
                <ol>
                  <li>Officially, the due date of this goal is before I have amassed a certain number of credit points
                    in my course,
                    which will likely be somewhere in my third year when I must complete an internship or have my
                    progress in my course put on hold. However, I am confident that I will be able to obtain an
                    internship for the second half of this year.
                  </li>
                  <li>Before I finish university, I want to have successfully completed a relatively large team project,
                    either inside or outside of course work.</li>
                  <li>I would like these projects to be completed within six months of their start date.</li>
                </ol>
              </td>
            </tr>

          </table>
          <br><br>
        </p>

        <h5>Week 4 - Professional Assessment Activity 1 and Supervisors </h5>
        <p>
          This week, our peer feedback group completed Professional Assessment Activity 1. In this activity, we provided
          feedback on each group member's
          ePortfolio. The suggestions for my portfolio were to attend an industry event and take a photo, to add more
          photos in general,
          and to add more to my learning journal. Additionally, I was asked to expand on the About Me section of my
          page, as well as provide a Job Analysis.
          I aim to implement these suggestions over the coming weeks in preparation for Professional Assessment Activity
          2, as well as for
          final submission.
          <br><br>
          We also were asked to explain what we expect from the administrative, developmental, and supportive elements
          of supervision. Personally, I expect
          supervisors to ensure that we meet the required standards from the company and any associated laws, relating
          to performance, quality, health, ethics, and safety.
          As for my development, I expect supervisors to evaluate my current performance and suggest plans to improve,
          as well as provide me with a clear plan as to what
          level of performance I should strive for. I also expect supervisors to support me when it comes to easing into
          new practices, frameworks, or hierarchies,
          checking in on me every so often to see if I am meeting targets and providing advice or additional support
          where necessary. Supervisors should make both my
          rights and responsibilities clear with regards to the workplace environment and industry.
          <br><br>
          Surprisingly, these thoughts did not differ between members of my feedback group. We were also asked to
          provide opinions on whether the following questions should
          be asked from a supervisor:
          <br><br>
          <ol>
            <li>Their professional experience and theoretical orientation?</li>
            <li>Their supervision history and their approach to supervising?</li>
            <li>How they feel about being given feedback by supervisees?</li>
            <li>Whether they have supervision themselves?</li>
            <li>Whether they view supervision as a priority?</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          Personally, I feel like these questions would come off as intrusive and inappropriate for what an employee
          would be trying to get out of a supervisor-employee
          relationship; therefore, I would ask none of them. If their supervision were to be problematic, only then
          would I bring these sorts of questions up.
          <br><br>
          This week, I also applied to an offer on CareerHub, having to write a short cover letter and adjust my resume.
          Unfortunately, I was not accepted due to only being in my second year of studies; however, this experience
          further prepared me
          for the offers I would have to respond to in the future for my internship. 
          <br><br>
        </p>
        </p>

        <h5>Week 5 - Critical Incident Journal and Occupational Health & Safety</h5>
        <p>
          This week, we had to write a critical incident journal entry recounting and analysing an occupational health
          and safety issue
          that we faced or witnessed as a student or in a job that we had. As my engineering field is software, the
          amount of occupational health and safety
          issues I am exposed to on a daily basis is limited, although I can think of one issue in particular related to
          OHS that occurred during a hackathon.
          <br><br>
          In December 2017, I participated in the Ludum Dare 40, which gave me only 72 hours to program a functional
          game. During development,
          I failed to adhere to many health and safety recommendations related to working with computers, such as taking
          frequent breaks and having my seat adjusted
          appropriately. The lack of breaks not only harmed my productivity by not being able to have a clear mind to
          fix bugs, but also took a strain on me physically,
          severely impacting my sleep schedule and resulting in wrist, neck, and back pain. Thankfully I had time to
          rest after the hackathon, but if this had happened
          during a more demanding time, or if crunch periods like this became a more regular occurrence, it would have
          serious impacts on my overall physical and mental
          health. Thus, in future hackathons, as well as anything else requiring large amounts of work in small time
          frames, I decided that it would be best to implement
          some project management techniques to allocate my work more effectively, or at the very least use some sort of
          pomodoro timer. This decision has not only improved
          my overall productivity substantially, but has also heavily minimised the effects of burnout. Additionally, by
          learning how to recognise the signs of burnout when
          writing code (e.g. getting stuck in thought loops, dry eyes, neglecting food and water, reduced code quality)
          I have been able to pace myself more appropriately
          when working on a task. When working under similar circumstances as a group, I also ensure that breaks are
          made a mandatory part of the development process for
          all team members, and that no team members are pressured into completing work at a rate that would induce
          burnout.

          <br>
          <em>Pictured: The slowly deteriorating code quality of my Ludum Dare submission. At 4:30am, after many hours
            of non-stop
            programming, variable names start to become improperly separated and both the code and my brain start to
            resemble spaghetti.
          </em>
          <br><br>
          We were also asked to identify the Occupational Health and Safety Regulations pertinent to the industry we
          want to enter.
          The field of software engineering does not seem to have any specific OHS policies apart from the generic
          policies of working in
          an office environment. OHS regulations related to software engineering include the Work Health and Safety Act
          2011 and the NSW Codes of Practice, and are regulated
          by SafeWork NSW. The obligations for employers are to exercise due diligence and the primary duty of care, to
          consult workers about their health and safety,
          to keep a register of all injuries, and to provide appropriate support for any workers injured at work.
          Employees, on the other hand, have the
          responsibilities of working safely, following instructions, asking if they're not sure how to safely perform a
          task, using personal protective equipment in a way that adheres to
          how they were trained and instructed to use said personal protective equipment, as well as reporting any
          injuries and unsafe or unhealthy situations to their supervisor or health
          and safety representative.

          <br><br>
          We were also asked to find out what Safe Work Method Statements are, as well as the obligations of employers,
          contractors, and employees in relation to them. From my research into the subject,
          it appears to have no application in the field of software engineering, but rather fields involving some sort
          of construction. A Safe Work Method Statement (not required for work of a minor nature)
          is a document setting out any high risk construction work activities to be carried out at a workplace. It
          includes the hazards arising from certain activities, as well as any measures that would be
          put in place in order to control the risks. Employers must ensure a Safe Work Method Statement is prepared,
          either by themselves or a third party, before any high risk construction work activities
          are initiated. Contractors have the responsibility of consulting with each other to determine the individual
          best positioned to prepare a Safe Work Method Statement, with health and safety representatives
          and both employers and employees involved in the development of the document, with employees providing
          relevant knowledge and experience to shape the document.

        </p>



        <br><br>

        <h5>Week 6 - Professional Assessment Activity 2 and Industry Event</h5>
        <p>
          This week, I provided feedback on other people's e-portfolios, as well as receiving feedback on my own e-portfolio. 
          The key recommendations for my portfolio were to properly implement my section about attending an industry event, and 
          adding a job market analysis. It was also recommended that I split my journal entries into multiple pages somehow. I also 
          received some positive feedback, with members of my feedback group saying that my journals were "reflective and in-depth", 
          that I included a lot of relevant personal experience, and that I was responding to the tutorial topics appropriately. 
          With regards to both me and the rest of my feedback group, not much changed between Week 4 and Week 6, aside from 
          some new journal entries; however, I plan to add much more between now and final submission. 
          <br><br>
          I will use this week's journal entry to discuss an industry event I recently attended, the inaugural UTS FEIT Student Game 
          Jam, which was a video game development hackathon that took place over approximately 24 hours. Although the games development 
          industry is quite small in Australia, this was still an extremely valuable experience for me, as I got to do pair programming 
          for the first time and learnt a lot about user interface design and user experience design, as well as some other topics 
          that have yet to be covered as substantially by my course. My other team member came from a more computer science oriented background, 
          and was thus able to teach me a lot about arrays, data structures, and other lower-level concepts, which were of significant help 
          for both the project we worked on as well as any software projects I will have in the future that deal with lower-level concepts. I was also 
          able to have discussions with people with experience in either the games or general software engineering industry, as well as students in much later 
          years than myself, which would have been good in terms of networking. We did surprisingly well for a two-person team in such a small amount of time, and I got to learn a lot about project management from both my team and observing 
          how other, more successful teams operated. This was also the first local game jam or hackathon that I have attended, as well as the shortest 
          one, which gave me a whole new perspective on handling deadlines. Although I consider my entries in other game jams/hackathons to be 
          of a much higher quality, due to the more generous amount of time I was given, the results of what I worked on would act as direct, physical evidence of 
          my ability to work under intense deadlines, programming ability, and creativity. Additionally, this event has made me more confident to attend future industry 
          events, and ended up connecting me to a community of students and other entities in the software engineering industry that I would have not known existed otherwise. Thus, 
          I believe that I will be able to leverage this experience to develop my connection with the engineering industry in Sydney.

        <h5>Week 7 - Summative Journal Entry</h5>
        <p>
          
          Overall, I strongly believe that I have adhered to and achieved the relevant Subject Learning Outcomes for this subject. 
          Upon successful completion of this subject, we are expected to articulate our preparedness for participating in an engineering workplace, and 
          document and communicate our capabilities to contribute to a workplace and engage in workplace learning. 
          I believe that I have successfully articulated my preparedness for participating in an engineering workplace through my critical incident journalling, job market analysis, and affirming my knowledge of software engineering practices and principles, and 
          I believe that I have successfully documented and communicated my capabilities to contribute to a workplace and engage in workplace learning through my introspective journal entries and demonstrable commitment to learning. 
          Setting clear short term and long term goals for my software engineering career has also given me things that are tangible and that I can work towards, furthering both my perceived sense of engineering identity, as well as my hard and soft skills as a software engineer. Thus, I believe that 
          I have fulfilled the Subject Learning Outcomes for this subject with at least a moderate degree of success.
