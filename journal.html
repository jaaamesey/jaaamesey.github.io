        <h4>Learning journal</h4>
        <p>The following entries are an account of my learning experiences while taking
          Engineering Practice Preparation 1.
        </p>
        <h5>Week 1</h5>
        <p>
          This week served as an introduction to the subject, 
          whilst also introducing us to the concept of workplace learning.
          We were also asked to write a few paragraphs on
          our understanding of engineering identity:
          <br><br>
          <em style="font-family: serif"> 
            Engineering identity refers to an engineer or engineering student's perceived role, value, and agency
            within the wider scope of their industry. Skill level, knowledge, and prior experience
            heavily contribute to one's sense of belonging and identity as an engineer within their community of
            practice; this sense in turn is associated with persistence and retention in academic programs and 
            the deepening of one's commitment to their career (Schell and Hughes, 2017). 
            <br><br>

            The process of "becoming an engineer" is referred to as "legitimate peripheral participation", 
            which is made up of three primary activities: the mastery of disciplinary knowledge, the navigation of formal and informal pathways
            into the profession, and the identification by others and oneself as an engineer. With regards to myself, 
            my navigation of formal and informal pathways and identification as an engineer is quite limited due to 
            lack of formal prior experience, and I find it difficult to quantify my mastery of disciplinary knowledge
            for similar reasons.
            <br><br>

            To develop my sense of engineering identity further, I will have to gain more formal experience in my field, 
            with increased exposure to professional software development environments. My sense of identity will also likely
            be furthered by conversing with established practitioners and applying relevant advice.

          <br><br>
          We were also asked to take a photo that represents what professional engineering practice means to us. I chose this motorised face piggy bank 
          as it contains many different components that would have each required considerable amounts of thought to put into, despite the bank itself 
          existing as a children's money saving mechanism at best and a cheap novelty at worst. To accept a coin, it must open its mouth and swallow it; this 
          is achieved through a spinning motor attached to part of its "skin". To know when a coin is placed near its mouth, it uses an always-on motion sensor.
          To power it, it takes two AA batteries. Despite how simple this item seems on the surface, and how easy it is to use, it still would have had to 
          go through the research, development, and manufacturing stages, as well as any stages in between. Thus, I feel that this item is representative of how 
          engineers are required to put considerable amounts of thought and effort into things that an ordinary user of the item would see as small and inconsequential, 
          and how even something as simple to the user as "put coin in mouth" require an understanding of many different components to implement. Engineers have to 
          think about all the things that the users of a product don't, which is why I feel that this item is representative of 
          professional engineering practice.

        <h5>Week 2</h5>
        <p>
            In week 2, we were introduced to the "sandwich" model of providing feedback, where criticisms are wrapped in an 
            easy to digest shell of multigrain bread, as well as the concepts of human, social, and cultural capital. Having been 
            born and raised in Australia, the same country I am looking for work in, the amount I will need to invest in cultural 
            capital will be minimal compared to the amount I will need to invest into human and social capital. Currently, the closest
            thing I have to social capital would be my membership to ProgSoc and participation in hackathons and game jams; thus, there
            is plenty of room for improvement in this area in the future, but I believe that the skills associated with my human capital 
            make up for it for the time being and would be significantly more important to a prospective employer. This week, I attended 
            a meeting with a company in Sydney about a potential internship opportunity, and although I was intoduced to the opportunity 
            through a neighbour, they were far more interested in technical skills, team skills, and work ethic compared to what people 
            and organisations I was associated with.
            <br><br>
            I have found the learning in this subject to be different to subjects relevant to my field; it is far more personal and more 
            about the development of the various soft skills that can be of use in a professional engineering environment.
            <br><br>
          </p>

        <h5>Week 3</h5>
        <p>
        This week, we had to fill out a table of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timely) goals.
        
        <br><br>          
        </p>

        <h5>Week 4</h5>
        <p>
          This week, our peer feedback group completed Professional Assessment Activity 1.  In this activity, we provided feedback on each group member's 
          ePortfolio. The suggestions for my portfolio were to attend an industry event and take a photo, to add more photos in general, 
          and to add more to my learning journal. Additionally, I was asked to expand on the About Me section of my page, as well as provide a Job Analysis.
          I aim to implement these suggestions over the coming weeks in preparation for Professional Assessment Activity 2, as well as for 
          final submission. 
          <br><br>
          We also were asked to explain what we expect from the administrative, developmental, and supportive elements of supervision. Personally, I expect 
          supervisors to ensure that we meet the required standards from the company and any associated laws, relating to performance, quality, health, ethics, and safety. 
          As for my development, I expect supervisors to evaluate my current performance and suggest plans to improve, as well as provide me with a clear plan as to what 
          level of performance I should strive for. I also expect supervisors to support me when it comes to easing into new practices, frameworks, or hierarchies, 
          checking in on me every so often to see if I am meeting targets and providing advice or additional support where necessary. Supervisors should make both my 
          rights and responsibilities clear with regards to the workplace environment and industry.
          <br><br>
          Surprisingly, these thoughts did not differ between members of my feedback group. We were also asked to provide opinions on whether the following questions should 
          be asked from a supervisor:
          <br><br>
          <ol>
            <li>Their professional experience and theoretical orientation?</li>
            <li>Their supervision history and their approach to supervising?</li>
            <li>How they feel about being given feedback by supervisees?</li>
            <li>Whether they have supervision themselves?</li>
            <li>Whether they view supervision as a priority?</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          Personally, I feel like these questions would come off as intrusive and inappropriate for what an employee would be trying to get out of a supervisor-employee 
          relationship; therefore, I would ask none of them. If their supervision were to be problematic, only then would I bring these sorts of questions up. 
        <br><br>
      </p>        
        </p>

        <h5>Week 5</h5>
          <p>
            This week, we had to write a critical incident journal entry recounting and analysing an occupational health and safety issue 
            that we faced or witnessed as a student or in a job that we had. As my engineering field is software, the amount of occupational health and safety 
            issues I am exposed to on a daily basis is limited, although I can think of one issue in particular related to OHS that occurred during a hackathon.  
            <br><br>
            In December 2017, I participated in the Ludum Dare 40, which gave me only 72 hours to program a functional game. During development, 
            I failed to adhere to many health and safety recommendations related to working with computers, such as taking frequent breaks and having my seat adjusted 
            appropriately. The lack of breaks not only harmed my productivity by not being able to have a clear mind to fix bugs, but also took a strain on me physically, 
            severely impacting my sleep schedule and resulting in wrist, neck, and back pain. Thankfully I had time to rest after the hackathon, but if this had happened 
            during a more demanding time, or if crunch periods like this became a more regular occurrence, it would have serious impacts on my overall physical and mental 
            health. Thus, in future hackathons, as well as anything else requiring large amounts of work in small time frames, I decided that it would be best to implement 
            some project management techniques to allocate my work more effectively, or at the very least use some sort of pomodoro timer. This decision has not only improved 
            my overall productivity substantially, but has also heavily minimised the effects of burnout. Additionally, by learning how to recognise the signs of burnout when 
            writing code (e.g. getting stuck in thought loops, dry eyes, neglecting food and water, reduced code quality) I have been able to pace myself more appropriately 
            when working on a task. When working under similar circumstances as a group, I also ensure that breaks are made a mandatory part of the development process for 
            all team members, and that no team members are pressured into completing work at a rate that would induce burnout.
