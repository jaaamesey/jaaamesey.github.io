        <p>The following entries are an account of my learning experiences while taking
          Engineering Practice Preparation 1.
        </p>
        <h5>Week 1</h5>
        <p>
          This week served as an introduction to the subject, 
          whilst also introducing us to the concept of workplace learning.
          We were also asked to write a few paragraphs on
          our understanding of engineering identity:
          <br><br>
          <em style="font-family: serif"> 
            Engineering identity refers to an engineer or engineering student's perceived role, value, and agency
            within the wider scope of their industry. Skill level, knowledge, and prior experience
            heavily contribute to one's sense of belonging and identity as an engineer within their community of
            practice; this sense in turn is associated with persistence and retention in academic programs and 
            the deepening of one's commitment to their career (Schell and Hughes, 2017). 
            <br><br>

            The process of "becoming an engineer" is referred to as "legitimate peripheral participation", 
            which is made up of three primary activities: the mastery of disciplinary knowledge, the navigation of formal and informal pathways
            into the profession, and the identification by others and oneself as an engineer. With regards to myself, 
            my navigation of formal and informal pathways and identification as an engineer is quite limited due to 
            lack of formal prior experience, and I find it difficult to quantify my mastery of disciplinary knowledge
            for similar reasons.
            <br><br>

            To develop my sense of engineering identity further, I will have to gain more formal experience in my field, 
            with increased exposure to professional software development environments. My sense of identity will also likely
            be furthered by conversing with established practitioners and applying relevant advice.

          <br><br>
          We were also asked to take a photo that represents what professional engineering practice means to us. I chose this motorised face piggy bank 
          as it contains many different components that would have each required considerable amounts of thought to put into, despite the bank itself 
          existing as a children's money saving mechanism at best and a cheap novelty at worst. To accept a coin, it must open its mouth and swallow it; this 
          is achieved through a spinning motor attached to part of its "skin". To know when a coin is placed near its mouth, it uses an always-on motion sensor.
          To power it, it takes two AA batteries. Despite how simple this item seems on the surface, and how easy it is to use, it still would have had to 
          go through the research, development, and manufacturing stages, as well as any stages in between. Thus, I feel that this item is representative of how 
          engineers are required to put considerable amounts of thought and effort into things that an ordinary user of the item would see as small and inconsequential, 
          and how even something as simple to the user as "put coin in mouth" require an understanding of many different components to implement. Engineers have to 
          think about all the things that the users of a product don't, which is why I feel that this item is representative of 
          professional engineering practice.

        <h5>Week 2</h5>
        <p>
            In week 2, we were introduced to the "sandwich" model of providing feedback, where criticisms are wrapped in an 
            easy to digest shell of multigrain bread, as well as the concepts of human, social, and cultural capital. Having been 
            born and raised in Australia, the same country I am looking for work in, the amount I will need to invest in cultural 
            capital will be minimal compared to the amount I will need to invest into human and social capital. Currently, the closest
            thing I have to social capital would be my membership to ProgSoc and participation in hackathons and game jams; thus, there
            is plenty of room for improvement in this area in the future, but I believe that the skills associated with my human capital 
            make up for it for the time being and would be significantly more important to a prospective employer. This week, I attended 
            a meeting with a company in Sydney about a potential internship opportunity, and although I was intoduced to the opportunity 
            through a neighbour, they were far more interested in technical skills, team skills, and work ethic compared to what people 
            and organisations I was associated with.
            <br><br>
            I have found the learning in this subject to be different to subjects relevant to my field; it is far more personal and more 
            about the development of the various soft skills that can be of use in a professional engineering environment.
        </p>

        <h5>Week 3</h5>
        This week, we had to fill out a table of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timely) goals.
